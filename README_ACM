How to build:

On Debian, install openafs-fuse and libopenafs-dev in addition to the usual AFS packages.

You also need bison and yacc (flex).

If not on Debian, you need to build and install libuafs from source (probably, assuming
openafs-fuse isn't packaged elsewhere).

Run:

* aclocal
* autoheader
* automake --add-missing
* autoconf

Then, the usual dance of:

* ./configure
* make

There should be lots of warnings on the fb_uafs.c file but it should build...
